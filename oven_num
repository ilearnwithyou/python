# This loop iterates on the value of the "n" variable in a range
# of 0 to 10 (the value of the end-of-range index 11 is excluded).
# The incremental value for the loop is 2. The print() function will 
# output the resulting value of "n" as the loop counts from 0 to 10 
# (end-of-range index 11) in incremental steps of 2. This is one 
# method that can be used in Python to print a list of even numbers.


for n in range(0,11,2):
    print(n)


# The loop should print 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10
